**Project Title**: Predicting Likes/Dislikes ratio on youtube videos using youtube data

This project aims to answer the question whether you can predict the ratio of likes and dislikes on youtube videos. I have chosen to analyse Joe Rogan Experience videos to answer the question. There are almost 1400 videos in the dataset, with a total of 3.5million comments. The features of the dataset were obtained through the Youtube Data API. Python files used to obtain and process the data are contained in the python_files folder. Testing of the sentiment analysis is contained within the sentiment_analysis_testing notebook, and the data analysis is contained in the data analysis notebook.
